# Exercise - where did he go?


Kim decided to go on three scooter trips throughout January, recording his whereabouts with his phone.
The recorded gps tracks (so-called *gpx* files) have been uploaded to the Teams folder:

Plot these tracks in ArcGIS Pro and find out where he went (including the island, land areas – e.g., Albert I land -, and location/valley names).

### Does Svalbox have digital datasets in the area visited by Kim?

The Svalbox database lives both in a petrel project as well as on the web -see [www.svalbox.no/map](www.svalbox.no/map)-.
Let’s use the available map data to see whether Svalbox has acquired digital models and / or photos in the places visited by Kim.

What is the outcrop model that Kim got closest too?

### Which geological units did Kim cross?

As per the above, we can also check which geological units Kim crossed on his trips. 

Other than just importing the entire G_Geologi_Svalbard_S250_S750 layers into your map, it is probably a better idea to import only the “Geological units / Geologiske enheter” from the Geologi 1:250000 layer group.
Then you can click on the map and get information about the layer.

Make a list of all formations that Kim passed during his trips and include the Groups and lithologies.
