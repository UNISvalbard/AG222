[EndNote](https://endnote.com/?language=en) is a desktop reference management and bibliography creation software. It exists to make your life easier when citing the sources you use for your work.


The first step is to create a new library where you can save your favorite articles.

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is linked with it. To do so, you have to select Cite and add to EndNote. It will be a downloadable file that automatically links to your Library.

In Word, we can insert the citation of the paper we are using. Moreover, it will automatically insert the full reference in the bibliography.

Finally, we can edit the way the citation displays and the style we are required to use.
