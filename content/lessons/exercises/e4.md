# Exercise 4: Create a Virtual Field Trip using Photo spheres

````{admonition} Task 4
:class: important

**Exercise**

After completing [Exercise 1](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/exercises/e1.html), which involved interpreting the major geological structures of one of the Digital Outcrop Models from the Svalbox database, and [Exercise 2](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/exercises/e2.html), which involved exploring the diverse resources available in Svalbard, it's time to integrate everything and create a Virtual Field Trip. To do this, utilize the Svalbox database and external resources such as geological and paleogeographical maps, sedimentary profiles, seismic data, or previous studies to prepare an engaging and captivating geological narrative. Your focus should be on addressing authentic and applied geological problems, creating a storyline that both informs and captivates your audience.

**Deliverables**

- Create a Virtual Field Trip and embed a minimum of: 1 geological map, 2 photo spheres, and 1 digital outcrop model (ideally with annotations).
- Export your Virtual Field Trip and share it with your colleagues.
- 30 minutes presentation of the VFT using ArcGIS Story Maps.

**Deadline**

TBD each year.

```{admonition} Main learning objectives
:class: note
By doing this exercise, you are expected to learn:
1. Search and download Photo spheres and Digital Outcrop Models from the Svalbox database
2. Search within the available data sets and resources presented in [AG222 Compendium - Data mining](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/data_mining/data_mining.html)
3. Create a Virtual Field Trip using ArcGIS Story Maps
4. Embed Photo spheres and Digital Outcrop Models to your VFT
```

## Background information
A virtual field trip is a type of field excursion that doesn't require traveling to the actual site. It involves integrating various tools and georeferenced data sets to create a coherent storyline. Virtual field trips are **seasonally independent**, **safe**, and **repeatable**. They also prepare students and professionals adequately for efficient fieldwork and can be used for post-fieldwork analyses.

Designing a virtual field trip requires several important skills, including teamwork, creativity, data mining, software proficiency, and geology.

There are many online platforms available to create Virtual Field Trips (VFTs). As discussed in the previous chapter, [ArcGIS Story Maps](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/story_maps/story_maps.html) is an excellent resource for creating VFTs, as demonstrated by the VFT called [Discover the fossilized world of Festningen, A short 300 million year walk along an Arctic beach](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/5efc4f9559c348f796e643b965a5b5e9).

However, there are other platforms to create VFTs, which can include virtual reality, with examples like the ones in [VR Svalbard](https://vrsvalbard.com/) by using [Pano2VR](https://ggnome.com/pano2vr/) or [Learning Arctic Biology](https://learningarcticbiology.info/360/vfg/map/).

## Resources

The [Svalbox CookBook](https://svalbox.github.io/Svalbox-cookbook/notes/interactive-portal.html), [AG222 Compendium - Data mining](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/data_mining/data_mining.html), and [AG222 Compendium - GIS](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/gis/gis.html#importing-a-digital-terrain-model) provides detailed guidelines on how to accomplish learning objectives 1 and 2. You can refer to the [ArcGIS Story Maps Tutorial](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/story_maps/story_maps.html) for a step-by-step explanation on how to create a Virtual Field Trip, by fulfilling objectives 3 and 4.
