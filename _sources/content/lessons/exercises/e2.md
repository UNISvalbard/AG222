:class: note
By doing this exercise, you are expected to learn:
1. Familiarize yourself with the Svalbox database and multiple online resources available in Svalbard
2. Search within the available  data sets and resources presented in [AG222 Compendium - Data mining](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/data_mining/data_mining.html) in an efficient and accurate manner
```

### Using Svalbox Interactive Map
The [Svalbox Map](http://svalbox.no/wp-content/scripts/svalbox-map/Wordpress_Map.php) is a UNIS-developed geoscience integration portal designed to provide an interactive interface to discover Svalbard’s geology.

Amongst the multiple datasets available, it highlights the Digital Outcrop Model (DOM) database, with a search functionality based on different parameters.

```{admonition} Task 1.1
:class: tip
Use the search functionality to answer the following questions:
1. How many DOMs were collected in 2021, 2022 and 2023?
2. In how many islands of the Svalbard archipelago have DOMs been acquired?
3. How many DOMs are located in Ny-Friesland? And in Nordenskiöld Land?
4. How many DOMs cover the Van Mijenfjorden Group?
```

Another useful resource available as part of the [Svalbox interactive map](http://www.svalbox.no/map) is the measuring tools.

```{admonition} Task 1.2
:class: tip
Use the measuring tools to answer the following questions:
1. What is the distance between Vassdalen II borehole and Ishøgda I borehole? _Hint - use [Toposvalbard](https://toposvalbard.npolar.no/) to help you locate these places._
2. What is the approximate area (in km2) covered by the photo spheres taken in Wallenbergfjellet?
3. What geological formations did the seismic line from STATOIL NH9108 -connecting Vassdalen II borehole and Reindalspasset I exploration well- cross? Which way is stratigraphically younger?
```

### Using Toposvalbard
[Toposvalbard](https://toposvalbard.npolar.no/) is one of the most common and best online resources when it comes to geospatial datasets in Svalbard. Amongst other functionalities, it has search function, where you can search places by name.

### Using ResearchInSvalbard
The [ResearchInSvalbard](https://researchinsvalbard.no/) -RiS for short- database, is a valuable resource for discovering ongoing and completed research projects in Svalbard. Though it does have some issues, such as containing projects that were never executed, it is still a helpful tool for gaining an overview of the research landscape and avoiding duplicative work. Additionally, the database can aid in coordinating logistics between different research teams.

5. Did they publish any results?
6. From which country/institute did they come?
7. List ca. 10 different campaigns in an appropriate table.
``` 

### Using Norwegian Petroleum Directorate FactMaps
The Norwegian Continental Shelf is one of the most data-rich areas in the world due to petroleum exploration activities. It is home to thousands of exploration wells and millions of kilometres of 2D and 3D seismic surveys. This abundance of data provides a valuable resource for geoscientific research and also serves as a framework for offshore CO2 storage. Sleipner has been storing CO2 since 1996, while Snøhvit has been doing so since 2008, and Aurora has started the Longship project recently.

All the data is owned by the companies that collect it, but it becomes public after a specific time period. Raw well logs become public after two years, seismic data after five years, and interpretations, reports, etc., after twenty years. The [Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD)](https://www.npd.no/en/) manages this vast data set and also offers useful [FactPages](https://factpages.npd.no/) and [FactMaps](https://factmaps.npd.no/factmaps/3_0/) that anyone can consult.

However, there is a downside. Although Svalbard is geologically a part of the Barents Shelf, it is not so politically. As a result, the exploration data for Svalbard is not readily available. If you're interested, check out the historical perspective on Petroleum, coal, and research drilling onshore Svalbard.

```{figure} assets/7_1_map_npd.png

```
```{admonition} Task 5
:class: tip
Use the [NPD FactMaps](https://factmaps.npd.no/factmaps/3_0/) to address the following tasks:
1. Where are the exploration wells? 
2. What is the northernmost well? 
3. When was the last exploration well drilled?
4. Which areas are currently licensed by oil companies?
5. Which areas are licensed on the Russian side of the border? _Hint: - see [http://wwfarcticmaps.org/](http://wwfarcticmaps.org/)_
6. What are the main geological elements? 
7. What is the age of the structures?
``` 

### Using Article Search and Methods
````{margin}
[EndNote](https://endnote.com/?language=en) is a desktop reference management and bibliography creation software. It exists to make your life easier when citing the sources you use for your work.

```{admonition} Resources
:class: note
You can refer to [Resources - EndNote](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/about/endnote.html) for a for a step-by-step explanation on how to use this reference management tool.
```
````

When it comes to science, the goal is not to start from scratch but to build upon existing knowledge by contributing new insights. This means that it's important to have a good understanding of the current state of the field, and to reference previous work effectively. UNIS has a license for [EndNote](https://endnote.com/?language=en) reference manager, which we will use in the course. This tool makes it easy to automatically import and archive references with their associated PDFs.

However, there are many other free and open access softwares for reference management and bibliography creation, such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

```{admonition} Task 6
:class: tip
1. Search for 5 relevant articles each using Google Scholar.
2. Load these into your EndNote library and include the .pdf file.
3. Each group to deliver a document including EndNote library of 20 articles and 3 corresponding word document with the bibliographic style of Geology, Earth-Science Reviews and Nature.
4. Focus on the data and methods of each paper.
- What have the researchers been doing?
- Could you reproduce their research?
- What is done well, and what could be improved in the articles?
```

### Using SvalSIM - The Svalbard Geosimulator
`````{margin}
```{admonition} Resources
:class: seealso
SvalSIM is available for Windows on the D: drive of UNIS PCs, it can also be used on your laptops during the course.
Access:
```

```
````
`````
SvalSIM is a GeoSimulator last updated in 2009 developed by Equinor as part of their inter-disciplinary Svalex student expeditions ran around Svalbard.

```{admonition} Task 7
:class: tip
1. Is there any data available for your area?
2. Take screenshots of relevant views of your study site.
3. Consider using SvalSIM to “film” your journey from Longyearbyen to your field area.
```

### Resources
You can refer to the [Svalbox CookBook](https://svalbox.github.io/Svalbox-cookbook/notes/interactive-portal.html) and the [G222 Compendium - Data mining](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/data_mining/data_mining.html) portal for a step-by-step explanation on how to fulfill the tasks and learning objectives.

--------

_Too much information? Don't worry, follow the tasks at your own pace. Moreover, we will, at regular intervals, pause and get a student to present (by sharing their screen and clicking the right buttons) how the task was achieved and what the results are to that point._

## Arctic Field Grant
The first step for any research project is securing the necessary funding to acquire data on the field.

To do research in Svalbard, the [Research Council of Norway](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/) provides [Arctic Field Grants](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/svalbard-science-forum/ssf-tools-and-funding-schemes/arctic-field-grant-afg/). These grants are available for master's students, PhD candidates, and researchers affiliated with Norwegian research organizations can receive funding for their field activities. The primary objective of these grants is to promote early career development in polar sciences and support the activities of students and researchers in this field.

Like anything else, the best way to succeed in a funding application is through practice and experience. Based on the location you explored in the previous tasks, write a fictive Arctic Field Grant application.

````{admonition} Task
:class: tip
