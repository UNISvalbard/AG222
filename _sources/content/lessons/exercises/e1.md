# Exercise 1: Interpret a Digital Outcrop Model

````{admonition} Task 1
:class: important

**Exercise**

Download a Digital Outcrop Model of your choice from the Svalbox model database and make 3D annotations using Agisoft Metashape. Interpret the major geological structures.

**Deliverables**

- You have to submit 3 figures showing your interpretations documenting your progress and results. **_Note that screenshots will not be accepted as a deliverable!_**
- A file in either .shp, .geotiff or .gpkg format containing your model interpretations.
Deliver the exercise in the MS Teams folder.
```{figure} assets/1_student_deliveries.png
:name: 1_student_deliveries

MS Teams folder.
```
The filename should be formatted as:
```
Exercise-1_{first-name}-{surname}.{extension}
```
Herein the curly brackets and text between them are variables, in this case first and surnames.

```{note}
These are individual exercises. However, you can work in pairs if you prefer, but each of you should deliver the exercises individually.
```

**Deadline**

TBD each year.

```{admonition} Main learning objectives
:class: note
By doing this exercise, you are expected to learn:
1. Search and download Digital Outcrop Models from the Svalbox model database
2. Make annotations on a 3D object
3. Analyze geomorphological structures
4. Export your interpretations in a way that they can be imported on a GIS software
```
