# Data mining and data integration

This module covers the basic online resources to find the information you need to conduct research in Svalbard.

Data mining is the process of discovering useful and insightful information from large datasets. This involves using various techniques from statistics, machine learning, and database management to extract valuable knowledge for your research. Data mining plays a crucial role in your research workflow. However, don't worry, this tutorial will guide you in uncovering hidden gems within the vast digital resources available in Svalbard.

```{admonition} Main learning objectives
:class: note
This course is split in several modules, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
The main learning objectives are:
- Familiarize and use Svalbox online portal
- Familiarize and use online resources
- Mining information 
- Present your findings in class
```

````{admonition} Data sets and resources
:class: note
The following provides a short overview of the most relevant resources for this module (and for the entire course):
- Course material is provided on the AG222 Teams folder – use your UNIS credentials to log in.
- We have set up a course data server, accessed from the UNIS network (also via VPN):
```
\\svalbox\AG222
``` 
Same as with the Teams folder, use your UNIS credentials to log in.

## Software

### Petrel
A industry-standard subsurface software with a very steep learning tool. We will be using Petrel in the Geomodelling part as part of the Billefjorden Trough work after Easter. 

### SvalSIM
A GeoSimulator last updated in 2009 developed by Equinor as part of their inter-disciplinary Svalex student expeditions ran around Svalbard. Available for Windows on the D: drive of UNIS PCs, it can also be used on your laptops during the course.

### GIS
A geographic information system (GIS) is a key component to integrate data geospatially, i.e., linking data to their physical locations on Earth. Multiple GIS software exist, some open access, like QGIS,  and some with payment licenses, such as ArcGIS.

GIS is a key tool that you will use during your geoscientific career. Consequently, we have developed a full section about it. You can access it [here](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/gis/gis.html).

## Relevant online resources:

### Svalbox
UNIS-developed geoscience integration portal, including digital outcrop models. See [https://www.svalbox.no/](https://www.svalbox.no/).

### TopoSvalbard
A topographic map of Svalbard also includes aerial images, terrain models, old oblique aerial photography. See [http://Toposvalbard.npolar.no](http://Toposvalbard.npolar.no)

### Svalbardkartet
It includes a geological map at 1:250 000 and 1:750 000 scale, and other relevant data sets. See [https://geokart.npolar.no/Html5Viewer/index.html?viewer=Svalbardkartet](https://geokart.npolar.no/Html5Viewer/index.html?viewer=Svalbardkartet) (turn on Geology).

### Norwegian Polar Institute Geodata portal
Access to many of the maps and data in TopoSvalbard and Svalbardkartet, [http://geodata.npolar.no](http://geodata.npolar.no).

### Stratigraphic lexicon of Svalbard
An overview of most of the formations you will work on. Paper copy in UNIS library (Dallmann 1999), online version available at [http://nhm2.uio.no/norges/litho/svalbard/index.htm](http://nhm2.uio.no/norges/litho/svalbard/index.htm).

### Stratigraphic lexicon
Stratigraphic lexicon for Norwegian offshore areas, including some timescales and templates.

### Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s FactMaps
Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s FactMaps on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. [http://www.npd.no/en/](http://www.npd.no/en/) (Advanced FactMaps)

### GeoSvalbard
Developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute. There is a sample database and many cross sections among others.

### Research in Svalbard database

A searchable database of research projects in Svalbard. Run by Svalbard Science Forum/Norwegian Research Council. At: [https://researchinsvalbard.no/](https://researchinsvalbard.no/).

### Google Scholar
Literature search, focus particularly on the methods section of articles – what do geologists do, and what methods do they use? Use the direct import function for EndNote to save time! [http://Scholar.google.com](http://Scholar.google.com)

### Google Earth
Global resource for geosciences works on the web, desktop, and mobile, but unfortunately poor base maps from Svalbard. But can include layers streamed from Geodata.npolar.no directly in GE. [https://www.google.com/earth/versions/](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/) 

### FATMAP
FATMAP is an Outdoor Adventure platform with high-resolution 3D map for both web and mobile. [https://fatmap.com/](https://fatmap.com/)
